      <h2>Encounter</h2>
      <h4>by Amanda Jernigan</h4>
      <p>
        A friend, seeing his babe in ultrasound,<br />
        imagined it an astronaut, “<span class="secret">b</span>ehind<br />
        glass dome reflections, lost in space…,”<br />
        and so I h<span class="secret">a</span>d that image close to mind<br />
        when the technician finally tipped her screen<br />
        to me, revealing—not an astronaut, <span class="secret">b</span>ut
        Earth,<br />
        so “small, light blue, so touchingl<span class="secret">y</span>
        alone.”<br />
        Thus Leonov. It was a commonplace,<br />
        back then, that once we had the earth <span class="secret">i</span>n
        sight,<br />
        the isolatio<span class="secret">n</span> of the planet “known,”<br />
        we would clean up our act, would mend our ways—<br />
        a kind of cosmic recognition <span class="secret">s</span>cene.<br />
        So much for that, the ske<span class="secret">p</span>tic in me says.<br />
        And yet as I beheld you flo<span class="secret">a</span>ting there<br />
        I felt myself grow small, the air grow thin,<br />
        as if I were the one adrift in spa<span class="secret">c</span>e,<br />
        and you the on<span class="secret">e</span> who might yet pull me in.<br />
