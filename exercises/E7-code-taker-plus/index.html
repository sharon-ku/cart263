      <h2>Encounter</h2>
      <p>
        A friend, seeing his babe in ultrasound,<br />
        imagined it an astronaut, “behind<br />
        glass dome reflections, lost in space…,”<br />
        and so I had that image close to mind<br />
        when the technician finally tipped her screen<br />
        to me, revealing—not an astronaut, but Earth,<br />
        so “small, light blue, so touchingly alone.”<br />
        Thus Leonov. It was a commonplace,<br />
        back then, that once we had the earth in sight,<br />
        the isolation of the planet “known,”<br />
        we would clean up our act, would mend our ways—<br />
        a kind of cosmic recognition scene.<br />
        So much for that, the skeptic in me says.<br />
        And yet as I beheld you floating there<br />
        I felt myself grow small, the air grow thin,<br />
        as if I were the one adrift in space,<br />
        and you the one who might yet pull me in.<br />
